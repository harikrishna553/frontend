      <h3>Sports</h3>

      <p>
        At ABC Engineering, we believe that physical fitness and teamwork are
        just as important as academic achievement. Our vibrant sports culture
        offers students a range of opportunities to engage in both competitive
        and recreational activities. Whether it's cricket, football, basketball,
        volleyball, or athletics, our state-of-the-art sports facilities and
        well-maintained grounds provide the perfect environment for athletes to
        thrive. Regular tournaments, inter-college competitions, and intramural
        leagues help foster a spirit of sportsmanship, camaraderie, and
        leadership among students. We encourage every student to participate and
        embrace a balanced, healthy lifestyle.
