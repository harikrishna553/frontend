      React is an open-source front-end JavaScript library, maintained by
      Facebook, that allows developers to build dynamic and responsive user
      interfaces. It is component-based, meaning you can build encapsulated
      components that manage their own state, and compose them to create complex
      UIs. React follows a declarative approach, where you describe what the UI
      should look like, and React handles updating and rendering components
      efficiently. It primarily focuses on the view layer of the application (in
      MVC architecture), making it easy to build reusable, fast, and interactive
      user interfaces.
